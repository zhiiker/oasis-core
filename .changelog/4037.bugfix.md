badger/migration: keep only last version when migrating non-managed DB

Even though oasis-core always configures non-managed badger databases to keep
a single version of keys, some databases in the wild contain multiple versions
of the same key.

Skip migrating more than the latest version when migrating non-managed
badger databases.

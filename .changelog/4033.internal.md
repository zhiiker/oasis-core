go/consensus/tendermint: Add typed attribute API

Using typed events makes it slightly harder to use an incorrect key/value
combination. Unfortunately we cannot use this in all of the cases due to
events in registry/roothash not being nicely structured and changing this
would require existing nodes to resync due to internal event key changes.
